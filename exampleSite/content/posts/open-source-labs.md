Then, with a movement which was as nearly as possible unconscious, he crumpled up the original message and any notes that he himself had made, and dropped them into the memory hole to be devoured by the flames."

# 🧪 Open Source Laboratory Information Management Systems (LIMS) Directory

Welcome to the comprehensive (and slightly silly) directory of open-source LIMS! Because managing lab data should be as fun as accidentally setting your lab coat on fire (but much safer).

## 1. OpenELIS
- 🔬 [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/openelisglobal/openelisglobal-core)
- 🌐 [Website](https://sites.google.com/site/openelisglobal/)
- 🤪 So open, it might accidentally share your lunch order with the whole lab

## 2. SENAITE
- 🔬 [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/senaite/senaite.core)
- 🌐 [Website](https://www.senaite.com/)
- 🤪 The cool kid on the block - thinks it's too cool for school, but actually does your homework for you

## 3. Bika LIMS
- 🔬 [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/bikalims/bika.lims)
- 🌐 [Website](https://www.bikalims.org/)
- 🤪 Not to be confused with a trendy juice cleanse - manages your samples better than you manage your social life

## 4. OpenLIS
- 🔬 [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/openlmis/openlmis-ref-distro)
- 🌐 [Website](https://openlmis.org/)
- 🤪 The hipster cousin of OpenELIS - liked open-source before it was cool

## 5. Baobab LIMS
- 🔬 [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/BaobabLims/baobab.lims)
- 🌐 [Website](https://baobablims.org/)
- 🤪 Perfect for when you need to manage both your biobank and your treehouse

## 6. FreeLIMS
- 🌐 [Website](https://www.freelims.org/)
- 🤪 Free as in beer, but probably shouldn't be used while drinking one
  (Note: No GitHub repo available - it's playing hide and seek!)

## 7. OpenSpecimen
- 🔬 [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/krishagni/openspecimen)
- 🌐 [Website](https://www.openspecimen.org/)
- 🤪 Open sesame? Nah, Open Specimen! Keeps your specimens more organized than your sock drawer

## 8. LabKey
- 🔬 [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/LabKey/server)
- 🌐 [Website](https://www.labkey.com/)
- 🤪 Unlocks the door to data management, but you still need a real key for the lab

## 9. OpenClinica
- 🔬 [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/OpenClinica/OpenClinica)
- 🌐 [Website](https://www.openclinica.com/)
- 🤪 Not just for clinics, despite what its name tells you - more flexible than your yoga instructor

## 10. MOLIS
- 🔬 [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/C4G/BLIS_archive)
- 🌐 [Website](https://www.ghdonline.org/uploads/MOLIS__concept_paper.pdf)
- 🤪 Microbes' favorite LIMS - makes managing microbiology almost as fun as growing a sourdough starter

## 11. ALIS
- 🔬 [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/mbcladwell/ALIS)
- 🤪 As adaptable as its lizard namesake - changes colors based on your mood (okay, not really, but wouldn't that be cool?)

## 12. LImBuS
- 🔬 [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/AberystwythSystemsBiology/limbus)
- 🌐 [Website](https://limbus.aber.ac.uk/)
- 🤪 Developed by Aberystwyth University (gesundheit!) - takes your biobank on a wild ride, but always gets you to your destination

Remember, in the world of open-source LIMS, the code is free, but the lab coats are BYO! May your samples always be organized and your data never corrupted. Happy lab-managing! 🧪🔬🧫
